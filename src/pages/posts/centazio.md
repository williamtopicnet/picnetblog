**Modern Enterprise Application Systems Architecture**

**Introduction**

The world has changed. Technology has changed.

Twenty-five years ago, we did not have the internet. Now, we could not live without it.

Enterprise systems used to be large, clunky, very expensive, slow, fragile, difficult to maintain, upgrade and replace. They used to be normally hosted in very large computers AKA Mainframes or very large and expensive Servers in a large and expensive server room or Data Centres.

Nevertheless, they were the only viable alternative for enterprises to improve productivity.

Sophisticated vendor management, especially on a global configuration, was paramount.

Nowadays, we are fortunate to have the option to deploy fantastic, best in class SaaS, subscription-based systems from multiple vendors, managed and supported by professionals and experts in their field.

**The old way: One large enterprise system**
<img src="/images/Picture2.jpg" alt="">

The only option available for companies was one large enterprise system that runs everything (warehouse, HR, Payroll, Finance, security, access, ordering, planning, etc)

Twenty years ago, it was the best possible strategy. One large system from one vendor, able to run most of your business, everywhere around the world, with expensive hardware, software and soon to be obsolete technology. The internet was in its infancy.! Client-Server architecture was the name of the game.

The Pros and Cons of this architecture were:

\- One large system

\- Very poor UI

\- Extremely hard to replace

\- Difficult to learn

\- Expensive and extensive training

\- Tied up to one vendor for 10-20 years

\- Long (multi-year) and expensive implementation

\- Implementation is normally late

\- Implementation is normally well above budget

\- Substantial capital expenditure

\- Normally, unhappy users

\- Expensive software, hardware, and skills

\- Large IT hardware infrastructure and support structure

\- Comprehensive need of backups and disaster recovery infrastructure

\- Need expensive and complex DRP (disaster recovery plans) and BCPs (business continuity plans)

\- High-risk exposure to cyber-attacks or data breaches. One system, one database for multiple functions. One attack cripples the whole operation of a company

\+ Multi-site, multi-country, and a large head office

\+ Provided one version of the truth

\+ Normally well integrated (it was one system!)

**As time progressed, we had the choice of ‘client/server’ solutions.**

This is not much better than the old way and hence it has been replaced by the following Modern architecture. In addition to the expensive hardware and software, many of the negatives of the old way prevail. On top, now we need a spaghetti-type integration or interfacing. This architecture is hard to maintain and therefore expensive and unreliable.

**The new – modern - way – Multiple, well-integrated, SaaS solutions**

As the internet became more prevalent and as technology has evolved significantly with new public cloud architectures, new development and database tools, new reporting, and multitenant capabilities; the **latest and best way** to deploy enterprise systems is not one large system but instead, **several small, SaaS subscription-based, low-cost software, best in class systems for each functionality required**.

<img src="/images/Picture4.jpg" alt="">

Pros and Cons:

\+ Easy to install (small systems)

\+ Subscription-based (low recurrent fees) i.e. Opex not Capex

\+ No server hardware required

\+ Normally doesn’t need DRP or BCP as quality SaaS system should be "highly available."

\+ Backups normally controlled by vendors (experts)

\+ Easy to upgrade, support, learn and replace

\+ Lower risk exposure to cyber-attacks or data breaches. Multiple systems are in place; hence one attack or data breach is likely to affect only a portion of the business

\- + Vendor size risk – small vendors can go out of business… but the system can be replaced easily as well

\-+ Multiple logins, multiple user/passwords controlled either by a single sign-on solution (like Okta) or by an enterprise password management solution with MFA e.g Lastpass

\+ If integrated correctly, each system talks to each other via an Integration tool (like Microsoft Azure Integration Services). If done incorrectly, each system talks directly to another **(spaghetti integration),** prone to high maintenance and breakdowns

\- Reliance on the internet

How to go about it.

In 2021, PicNet remains a leader in IT strategic thinking.

PicNet has the capabilities to understand your business, research the best SaaS solutions for you, create an integrated architecture, efficiently integrate those systems using modern integration tools and processes (see PIOMP below), deploy and reap the productivity and financial benefits of the new enterprise architecture deployed.

PicNet, 20 years in business keeping up with all the major technological changes for the benefit of the enterprise.

PicNet’s Centazio is a collection of services and products that facilitate the implementation of Azure Integration Services (iPaaS):

- The services:
    
    - Consulting – Design, Strategize, Find SaaS Solutions
    
    - Project Management
    
    - Business Analysis
    
    - Implementation
- The product:
    
    - PIOMP Licences
    
    - PIOMP Deployment, customisation and maintenance and support
    
    - AIS Licences, Provisioning and management

Our customers benefit from our considerable iPaaS (Azure Integration Services) experience hence our Centazio approach of Services and Products to support your integration journey.

Over time we have identified the most common tasks that most integration projects require.

From this experience, we have built Centazio PIOMP, the “PicNet Integration, Orchestration and Master Data Platform” to address these items quickly and efficiently.

**The key tasks included in Centazio PIOMP can solve for you today:**

- Efficient acquisition and deployment of Azure resources
- Reproducible Azure deployment
- Tools to start/stop Azure environments reducing cost
- Tools to assist in other miscellaneous and standard maintenance tasks
- Code to assist:
    - Efficient development of Azure functions
    - Efficient usage of Azure Service Bus
    
- Best practices to assist in staging entities
    - Staging is the step of copying source system data in an unmodified format to the database.
    - Best practices to promote entities (promoting is taking staging data and converting it into a common format that can then be saved in the master data database).
    - Best practices to assist in long-running and complex workflows
    - Best practices in creating a star-schema style master database that supports reporting out of the box
    
- Managed services
    - Once the initial implementation is complete, PicNet provides ongoing maintenance, enhancements, upgrades, and improvements under a longer-term Managed Services agreement.
