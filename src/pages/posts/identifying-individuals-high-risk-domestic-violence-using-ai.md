### One of the [Top 12 Artificial Intelligence Innovations Disrupting Healthcare by 2020](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-12-artificial-intelligence-innovations-disrupting-healthcare-by-2020?eid=CXTEL000000356741&elqCampaignId=9457&elqTrackId=2b3f100aaf1d427296901b632d02eb05&elq=4d3e0556031e4b918abb8668b8933df8&elqaid=9945&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=9457)

Under reporting makes it difficult to know just how many people suffer from intimate partner violence (IPV), says Bharti Khurana, MD, an emergency radiologist at BWH. But the symptoms are often hiding in plain sight for radiologists.

Using artificial intelligence to flag worrisome injury patterns or mismatches between patient-reported histories and the types of fractures present on x-rays can alert providers to when an exploratory conversation is called for.

“As a radiologist, I’m very excited because this will enable me to provide even more value to the patient instead of simply evaluating their injuries. It’s a powerful tool for clinicians and social workers that will allow them to approach patients with confidence and with less worry about offending the patient or the spouse,” said Khurana.
