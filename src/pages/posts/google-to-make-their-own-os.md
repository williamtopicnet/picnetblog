Just as Google has bought many of its apps out of beta this week it has announced it is working own its own Google Chrome Operating System!

Is this the new golden bullet operating system for Netbook PC's????

It looks as if Google is entering more and more into Microsoft's domain in many areas.

You can read more about the new OS here on Google's own blog:
