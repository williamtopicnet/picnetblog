### **STREAMLINING WORKFLOWS WITH VOICE-FIRST TECHNOLOGY**

 

# One of the [Top 12 Artificial Intelligence Innovations Disrupting Healthcare by 2020](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-12-artificial-intelligence-innovations-disrupting-healthcare-by-2020?eid=CXTEL000000356741&elqCampaignId=9457&elqTrackId=2b3f100aaf1d427296901b632d02eb05&elq=4d3e0556031e4b918abb8668b8933df8&elqaid=9945&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=9457)

 

[Natural language processing](https://healthitanalytics.com/features/what-is-the-role-of-natural-language-processing-in-healthcare) is already a routine part of many behind-the-scenes clinical workflows, but voice-first tools are expected to make their way into the patient-provider encounter in a new way.

[Smart speakers](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/nuance-beats-competitors-to-ambient-computing-in-the-clinic) in the clinic are prepping to relieve clinicians of their EHR burdens, capturing free-form conversations and translating the content into structured documentation. Physicians and nurses will be able to collect and retrieve information more quickly while spending more time looking patients in the eye.

Patients may benefit from similar technologies at home as the consumer market for virtual assistants continues to grow. With companies like Amazon [achieving HIPAA compliance](https://mhealthintelligence.com/news/now-hipaa-compliant-amazons-alexa-opens-up-to-mhealth-uses) for their consumer-facing products, individuals may soon have more robust options for voice-first chronic disease management and patient engagement.
