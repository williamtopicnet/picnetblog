**What is PredictBench?**

[PredictBench](https://picnet.com.au/predictbench/) is a solution that helps organisations predict with confidence future business events based on their own historical data and other influential variables. It allows organisations to answer questions such as:

- What marketing campaign will give me the greatest return on investment

- How much to produce of a certain product to optimise supply

- How to measure the risk that a customer represents

- When a particular failure may occur

- What maintenance programs to develop in order to minimise a risk

In the past these technologies have only been available to Silicon Valley research start-ups or corporate giants. We bring this technology to all corporations and government entities in an affordable and efficient solution that aims to deliver real value for money.
