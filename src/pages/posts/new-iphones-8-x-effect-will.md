In effect, investors are of the belief that the new positioning of the iPhone X will yield considerably higher profits as they are aiming for the higher end of the social ladder, focusing considerable efforts on mature markets.<div></div>Fortunately for Apple, there are a slew of features relating to the new iOS 11, set to be released on the 19th of September, which Apple believe will fully justify the “luxury” model price-tag (1).<div></div>Some of the new operating features include:<div></div>· The automatic blocking of notifications when your device ascertains that you are driving<div></div>· A Siri overhaul that encompasses a more humanised tone and a powerful implementation of machine learning to a degree whereby Siri will make suggestions, such as queuing songs, based on the previous behaviour of the user<div></div>· “Offload Unused Apps” will automatically remove seldom used apps in an effort to save storage space<div></div>· An update to Apple Pay will allow users to send money to other users on the iOS 11 through a simple text message (2).</td><td width="2">​</td></tr></tbody></table>

Concerns about police or criminals being able to forcibly scan your face to unlock your phone have been raised. Furthermore, just as the Apple’s TouchID was hacked with fake fingerprints, many experts believe it is only a matter of time before this new piece of tech is also compromised (4).<div></div>All of the features of the iOS 11 (mandatory operating system on the new iPhones) have a core focus on increasing productivity in an attempt to not only bolster the initial market position of the iPhone X, but also lengthen the marginal utility of a slew of other Apple products, including the iPhone 6, 7 and 8, as well as the iPad Pro and the fifth generation iPads such as the iPad Air. (5)<div></div>&nbsp;<div></div><a href="https://picnet.com.au/blogs/marco/files/2017/09/p3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-465 migrated-image" src="images/p3.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="275"></a><div></div>&nbsp;</td><td width="2">​</td></tr><tr><td width="2">​</td><td width="900">Amidst the consumer driven spectacle that normally accompany these perennial announcements, Google’s Android Oreo seems to be the winner in the eyes of neutral tech commentators due to a stronger underlying AI offering, singling out features such as being able to copy a Wi-Fi password by focusing the camera over it, the ability to shrink apps into thumbnails so that you are able to simultaneously complete many functions and password autofill function for Chrome. Other improvements include a longer battery life and an operating speed said to be twice as fast as its predecessor (6).<div></div>It’s important to note that the battle is far from over as both Samsung and Apple love to keep the surprises coming, especially closer to when the newest models are officially released. Will journalistic sentiment translate into Samsung gaining back some of the coveted smartphone market-share it so desperately desires? Only time will tell but one thing is for sure: the intense amount of competition between the competing developers can only mean positive outcomes for the end user as both Apple and Google push each other to deliver value in ways that will exponentially improve user experiences for many years to come.<div></div>Marco.</td><td width="2">​</td></tr></tbody></table>
