It gives me great pleasure to anounce that [PicNet's](https://picnet.com.au) closure control library is now public.  We have started with only 2 of our controls but over the next few weeks we will port all of our control code to this [project](https://github.com/PicNet/picnet_closure_repo).

For a demo just visit [http://picnet.github.com/picnet\_closure\_repo/demos/](http://picnet.github.com/picnet_closure_repo/demos/).

The google closure library is a project that I think is greatly under represented and I hope that this on going contribution does something to fix that.

Currently the library includes a Date Range Picker and a 'off the page' slide in and out panel.  See the demo for the full details.  

This demo will also be updated every time a new Control/Component is added.

Thanks

Guido Tapia
