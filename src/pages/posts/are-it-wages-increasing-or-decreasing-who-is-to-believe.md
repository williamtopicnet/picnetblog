Are IT wages increasing or decreasing – who is to be believed?

The Australian Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor has said that the “vacancies for local IT workers were decreasing and that real wages in the IT sector had fallen between 5% and 12% in recent years”(1)

A recent report by Michael Page International (Technology) indicates that “over the last 12 months, business activity across the technology sector in Australia continued at a consistent level”. It follows saying that “there is currently high demand for business engagement and project services skills, as well as Project Managers, Change Managers and Business Analysts…” It goes further saying that “with demand for experienced technology professionals likely to rise as company investment continues, employers will need to review salaries to retain and attract talent”. An average salary increase of 3% to 4% can be expected”. “Looking ahead, recruitment activity in the technology sector is expected to remain strong over the next 12 months…” (2)
