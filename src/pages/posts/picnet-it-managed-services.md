IT Managed Services is the practice of transferring day-to-day related IT management responsibility as a strategic method for improved operations and focus on core business.

PicNet [www.PicNet.com.au](https://picnet.com.au/) provides managed services for:

- T Infrastructure Management and Support
- IT Software Development and support
- IT project Management and Consulting

Typically, the customer remains accountable for the functionality and performance of the IT managed service and does not relinquish the overall management responsibility to PicNet.

IT is core to your businessâ€¦ our core business is IT
