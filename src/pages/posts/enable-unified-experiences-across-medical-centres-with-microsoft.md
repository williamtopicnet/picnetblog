The goals of digital health are complex and diverse. Preventing disease, reducing healthcare costs, customizing medicines to patient needs, and assisting in monitoring and managing chronic conditions are just some of them. Most of these aspirations have a common purpose, though: providing medical professionals and healthcare providers with efficient tools that allow them to do more with less. Empowering medical professionals also means increasing their ability to collaborate with colleagues and share information critical to disease prevention and treatment, potentially saving countless lives.

Over time, these tools don’t just improve patients’ quality of life, they can also decrease the cumulative expenses that patients incur across their lifetimes, reducing expenses for patients and care providers alike.

Digital technology also enables medical centres to provide smarter, more efficient operations by allowing them to safely store patient records in the cloud and collaborate seamlessly with other facilities around the world.

This shift promises to benefit both healthcare providers and their patients by empowering doctors with improved data collection that guides them in helping patients adopt healthier lifestyles, effectively reducing hospital and other medical centre visits.

Watch this video to learn how the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in Victoria, Australia, is using Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 to provide smart solutions that are being used to unify experiences across medical centres and enable knowledge-sharing among medical professionals.
