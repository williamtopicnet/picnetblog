Only click links from trusted senders. A simple trick is to hover your mouse over the link to check the destination in your browser if it doesn’t match then it’s not legitimate.

  

If you are not sure, type the URL of the organisation you are intending to visit manually into your browser or navigate through Google search to find the correct website before entering your credentials.

  

Never open an attachment that seems suspicious as files from unknown senders often contain malware or virus.

  

Take a close look at the email address of the sender – even if it looks legitimate, there are keys to show it has been forged.

  

**Other scams to watch for:**

  

The scam tells sends a message to intended victims that a new email address has been added to their (for instance) PayPal and gives them the chance to make it their primary address or to report the email if it has been added by mistake.

  

“If you didn’t add this email, let us know right away. It’s important because it helps us make sure no one is getting into your account without your knowledge,” it reads.

  

Unsuspecting recipients who click on the “let us know right away” hyperlink are taken to a convincing copy of the PayPal website where they are asked to login using their email or mobile number.

  

After clicking “next’” the user is led to a similar page that prompts them to enter their password.

  

Subsequent pages ask intended victims to update their billing address and credit card information before being redirected to the actual PayPal website.

  

“E-commerce companies such as PayPal commonly hold a well-established and trusting relationship with customers, so when cybercriminals are looking for good trademarks to use in their email attacks they often brandjack companies like these,” email security service MailGuard said.

  

“Several techniques have been employed in this email to look like a genuine notification from PayPal, including the usage of high-quality graphical elements such as the company’s logo and branding.

  

“Another technique is the attempt to evoke urgency; telling the recipient to ‘let us know right away’ creates a sense of anxiety and panic that their account isn’t safe.”
