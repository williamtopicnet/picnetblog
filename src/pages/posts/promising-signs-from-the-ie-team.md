I was excited to read about [IE joining the W3C SVG Working Group](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/01/05/microsoft-joins-w3c-svg-working-group.aspx). This hopefully means that IE 9 will have SVG support.

There has been [a lot of noise](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/11/18/an-early-look-at-ie9-for-developers.aspx) around IE 9 and graphics rendering but this is the first solid hint as to which direction that will take.

I am crossing my fingers that CANVAS is not ignored. Come on IE stop being humiliated by Google (excanvas, svgweb, gears and chrome frame) and implement these standards!!!!

Thats my rant done.
