The newly released Windows Server 2008 R2 has a stack of new features that build on the award-winning Windows Server 2008. This new version expands on existing technologies and enables organisations to increase the reliability and flexibility of their server infrastructures.

New virtualisation tools, Web resources, management enhancements, and exciting Windows 7 integration will help save time, reduce costs, and provide a platform for a dynamic and efficiently managed datacentre.

Powerful tools such as Internet Information Services (IIS) version 7.5, updated Server Manager and Hyper-V platforms and Windows PowerShell version 2.0 combine to give customers greater control, increased efficiency and the ability to react to front-line business needs faster than ever before.
