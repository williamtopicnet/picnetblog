**A – For the motion**

John Boitnott (inc.com) goes to say: “Social media updates are similar to eating French fries. If you're like most people, you can't have just one.” Furthermore he says: “social media addiction is a productivity Killer”.

An extract of his full article follows (Full article here: [http://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/social-media-addiction-the-productivity-killer.html](http://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/social-media-addiction-the-productivity-killer.html))

“Social media can be truly addicting, which makes it tough for entrepreneurs who want to curb its use because it can be so time consuming. Going cold turkey may not be an option.

Unlike other potentially addictive items such as nicotine or alcohol, social media is an integral part of many peoples' actual work goals and can't be ignored. You might be charged with updating the business' digital photo albums, managing comment threads or some other business directive. Short of refusing to do your duties, social media addicts have to learn to deal with their disease.”

A study (study referred in the full article) revealed that 18 percent of users can't go beyond "a few hours" without checking Facebook and 61 percent of users check their newsfeed "at least once a day."

“Of iPhone users, 28 percent check their Twitter feed before getting up in the morning. It's estimated that the average American spends nearly one quarter of their work day browsing social media for non-work related activities.

In fact, somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of Americans admit they don't go online for anything necessary, but rather to kill time or be entertained. **For bigger businesses, this means if one thousand of your employees spend just one hour per day "cyberloafing," it could cost you $35 million each year**. “

 

**B – A solution?**

**Is this spying or managing productivity? You be the judge**

**C- Against the motion**

**A**n extract of Ilya Pozin’s article in forbes.com says: **Social Media Actually Increases Productivity**

 

We all know social media is a horrible drain on workplace productivity…right? After all, if you’re on [Facebook](http://www.forbes.com/facebook-ipo/) and Twitter, you’re probably not getting your work accomplished. But a few surveys tell a different story.

[According to a recent survey by Microsoft](https://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/social-media-workplace-survey_b45390), 46 percent of workers say their productivity has improved thanks to social media and social media tools. A further 37 percent wish their organization’s management would embrace social media tools in the workplace in order to increase productivity. Of course, this is discussing the wide scope of social tools in the office, many focused specifically on productivity, instead of the big social networks we all know and love to waste time surfing.

However, even social media with no ties to your workplace can make you more productive on the job. Research by the University of California, Irvine team found occasionally “grazing” social media sites like Facebook can work as a mood booster. These social media breaks can act as a mental palate cleanser, helping workers with a quick mood enhancer, allowing you to return back to the task at hand refreshed.
