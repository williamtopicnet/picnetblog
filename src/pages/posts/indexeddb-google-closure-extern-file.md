I've been doing some work with [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/) (on [Mouse Eye Tracking](http://met.picnet.com.au/)) recently and created a [closure extern file (download)](https://picnet.com.au/blogs/guido/files/2010/08/indexeddb.extern.js) to help with the process.

Hope this helps someone :)

Please let me know if someone would like me to create an open source project somewhere to continue improving this.

**Note:** The specs and FF implementation appear to be changing very quickly so this is just a guide as I'm sure it will be out of date soon.

Please assume MIT license.

Thanks
