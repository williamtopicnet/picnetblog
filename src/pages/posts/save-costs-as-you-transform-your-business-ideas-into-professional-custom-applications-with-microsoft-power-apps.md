As a business leader, you understand the importance for being cost-effective and saving money when you can. Good news: Microsoft Power Apps empowers you to build professional, custom applications while saving money. Power Apps delivers a high Return on Investment (ROI) within a three-year term and is on average **74% less expensive** than other app development platforms.

This is proven by a study conducted by Forrester to help businesses understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with implementing Microsoft Power Apps. The study which can be downloaded [here](https://picnet.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TEI-of-MSFT-Power-Apps-2020.pdf) reveals a reduced cost in application development and vendor licence costs, an improved process automation and business outcomes, and additional value realised when integrated with other Microsoft solutions.
