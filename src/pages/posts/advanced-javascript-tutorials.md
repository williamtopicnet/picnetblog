I've decided to do a series of videos on using Javascript. I believe that js is one of the most poorly used tools out there and I think that is because it is different to most languages and those differences are slight enough to slip under the covers. I.e. People can develop in javascript using their Java/.Net skills but they do it badly.Â 

I will try to do a video or so every week, each week highlighting pitfalls for experienced developers may find. I will keep this blog post updated when a new video is added.

<b>Note</b>: The series is complete, please let me know if you would like me to cover any other topics.
