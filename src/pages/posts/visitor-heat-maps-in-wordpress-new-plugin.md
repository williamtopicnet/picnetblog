Hi All,

I'm pleased to announce that we have just released a new WordPress plugin that will allow you to effortlessly add the [PicNet Mouse Eye Tracking](http://met.picnet.com.au/) service to your WordPress website / blog. Now you can see exactly what your visitors are doing on your web site and not need to change a single html file.

For full details on what [Mouse Eye Tracking](http://met.picnet.com.au/) can do for your web site see the [home page](http://met.picnet.com.au/).

[Download the plugin.](https://picnet.com.au/blogs/guido/files/2010/05/picnet_mouse_eye_tracking.zip)
