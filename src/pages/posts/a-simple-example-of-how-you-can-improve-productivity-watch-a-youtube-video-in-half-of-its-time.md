Want to increase your productivity? 

**When you want to watch a YouTube video of a presentation or someone talking for a long time, just increase its speed with this plug in:**

**YouTube HTML5 Video Player [http://www.youtube.com/html5](http://www.youtube.com/html5)**

**You can watch a 1 hr video in half or less of its time.**

**You need a modern browser (able to play HTML5) - Chrome, Firefox, etc**
